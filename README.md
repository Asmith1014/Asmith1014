About me:
My name is Alisha Smith, I am 31, I started my professional journey working for the City of New York in their Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) under the HRA umbrella.
After that I finished school, branched out into office work at start-ups, realized that wearing many hats wasn’t my passion, moved into executive assistant work, did a little teaching
and then turned my hand toward the nonprofit sector. After managing high profile partnership in the nonprofit sector, I decided to take my
life in a new direction. I have secretly returned to school for my second degree where I am focused on entering the tech sector for data analytics, which I had the pleasure of pursuing
privately for a while before I decided to commit to a second tuition. I’m a mean chef. I am a self-proclaimed gamer, and I’m currently engaged! I am now back at Baruch and am majoring in
Computer Science and am hoping to put my bright personality, and hard - work ethic toward a new position or internship as soon as possible.
